Complete the solution so that it strips all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out.

Example:

Given an input string of:

```text
apples, pears # and bananas
grapes
bananas !apples
```

The output expected would be:

```text
apples, pears
grapes
bananas
```

The code would be called like so:

```csharp
string stripped = StripCommentsSolution.StripComments("apples, pears # and bananas\ngrapes\nbananas !apples", new [] { "#", "!" })
// result should == "apples, pears\ngrapes\nbananas"
```
